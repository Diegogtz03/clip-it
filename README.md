## üí° Idea

Clip-it came as an idea after learning my grandpa was diagnosed with **_Alzheimer_**, this was the moment I realized how important our memories are and how often we take for granted those small special moments we live day to day. We sometimes have so much going on in our daily lives that we forget to relive those small moments or forget something important. I wanted to create an easy to use iPhone application which allowed to quickly record those moments, either audios or pictures with small annotations, with the intention of capturing that awesome song you heard at the mall or those tasty chips you had at a friend‚Äôs house.

Clip-it is the combination of all of these ideas resulting in a quick and easy to use iPhone app made in honor of people with Alzheimer‚Äôs as a reminder to us to cherish and value those small moments in our lives.

I designed Clip-it with iPhones in mind, which is why I would recommend running the app with the iPhone simulator. Features like photo taking will crash on the simulation given the lack of input/output on the cameras, but eature like audio recording and history will work in the simulator.
